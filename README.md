# Client-Server-Student-Info-application
 A four (4) layer ASP .NET core website application that uses a database that contains tables for the information of students, their courses, grades and divisions, and uses a context class in the DAL (1st layer) of the project to use the database. Also in the DAL are the entity classes that get and set the entities of the tables in the database, in addition with a Repository and DAO classes to create methods to be used for testing in the Tests layer (2nd layer). In the Tests layer, there is a DAOTests class that tests the methods in the DAO, a Linq test for the data in certain entities and a ViewmodelTests to test for the methods in the Viewmodel classes which are in the ViewModel layer (3rd Layer). In the ViewModel layer, viewmodel classes that read from the DAO's and use the entities from the tables and contains methods manipulate that data. Created the Website Layer (4th Layer) that contains the javascripts, HTML's and controllers that has methods to get data by an entity in a table, get all the data, update data, add data and delete (CRUD functionality).
